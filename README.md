# Starter React Native Frontend

This is a stripped down Expo app based on the Graysky project. It keeps only the UI structure so you can plug in your own APIs.

## Features

- Login screen that navigates to the main app when the button is pressed.
- Bottom tab navigation with Home and Profile pages.
- The feed page is empty; add your own API logic.
- Profile page placeholder.

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install --filter starter-app...
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter starter-app dev
   ```

This will open the Expo dev tools where you can run the app on iOS, Android or web.
